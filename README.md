# Question 2 ==> ReactJS - Responsive virtual masonry of selectable and draggable images

many npm packages are available to create a masonry grid in react:

1. masonic (only masonry grid)
2. gristack.js (masonry and draggable and resizable)
3. react-grid-gallery (masonry and selectable)

But we need all the three at the same time ==>

- masonry
- draggable
- selectable
